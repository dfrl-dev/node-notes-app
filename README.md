# node-notes-app


A basic notes app using node.js.  Based on "The Complete Node.js Developer Course" on udemy.

The app operates using node in the command line.

Commands:

add - adds a note. requres --title and --body as command line arguments.
remove - removes a note, searching through the json file for the a title matching the --title argument
list - lists all notes
read - read a specific note based on the provided --title argment in the command line.

The app creates and edits and parses a local JSON file.

My first foray into node.js!
